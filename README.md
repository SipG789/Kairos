## Password Generator Application 

### In this application I attempted to create a password generator that rendered a password based on user input. At the moment the commands do prompt up and a password is generated. However, I can't seem to get the user input to output the same total of characters for the password. 

### I used the following resources to help me build my code:
```
www.w3schools.com
www.stackoverflow.com 
UTSA Bootcamp Module 3
Robot Gladiators
```

The following image shows a screenshot of the application.
