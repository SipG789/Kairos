Password Generator Application 

### In this application I attempted to create a password generator that rendered a password based on user input. The application currently does not give out more than one input. However, I was able to get the confirmations to work. 

### I used the following resources to help me build my code:
```
www.w3schools.com
www.stackoverflow.com
UTSA Bootcamp Module 3
```

The following image shows a screenshot of the application.
